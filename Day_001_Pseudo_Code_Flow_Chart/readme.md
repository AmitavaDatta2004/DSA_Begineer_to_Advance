# Pseudo-code and Flowchart

## Flowchart
A flowchart is a diagram that visually represents the steps or processes involved in completing a task or solving a problem. It uses standardized symbols, such as ovals, rectangles, diamonds, and arrows, to depict different actions, decisions, or sequences.

### Common Flowchart Symbols:
- **Oval**: Start or End of a process.
- **Rectangle**: A process or action step.
- **Diamond**: A decision or branching point (yes/no or true/false).
- **Arrows**: Show the flow of the process from one step to another.
- **Parallelogram**: Input or Output.

### Uses of Flowcharts:
- Understanding, documenting, or analyzing processes.
- Troubleshooting or improving workflows.
- Planning new systems or algorithms.
- Training or communicating processes within teams.

Flowcharts are widely used in programming, business process management, and problem-solving tasks.
