# Pseudo-code and Flowchart

## Flowchart
A flowchart is a diagram that visually represents the steps or processes involved in completing a task or solving a problem. It uses standardized symbols, such as ovals, rectangles, diamonds, and arrows, to depict different actions, decisions, or sequences.

### Common Flowchart Symbols:
- **Oval**: Start or End of a process.
- **Rectangle**: A process or action step.
- **Diamond**: A decision or branching point (yes/no or true/false).
- **Arrows**: Show the flow of the process from one step to another.
- **Parallelogram**: Input or Output.

### Uses of Flowcharts:
- Understanding, documenting, or analyzing processes.
- Troubleshooting or improving workflows.
- Planning new systems or algorithms.
- Training or communicating processes within teams.

Flowcharts are widely used in programming, business process management, and problem-solving tasks.

## Pseudocodes

Pseudocode is a simplified, informal way of describing the steps of an algorithm or a program using plain language that resembles programming structures. It's not actual code, but it uses logical sequences, control structures (like loops and conditionals), and basic syntax to outline how a program should work. Pseudocode is easy to read and understand, making it helpful for planning algorithms without focusing on programming language syntax.

### Features of Pseudocode:
- **Readable**: Written in plain English, making it understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Structured**: Uses programming concepts like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `else`), and functions.
- **Abstract**: Focuses on logic and structure rather than language-specific details (no variable declarations, strict syntax rules, etc.).

### Example of Pseudocode for Checking Even or Odd:

```plaintext
1. Start
2. Input number
3. If number % 2 == 0:
      Display "Even number"
   Else:
      Display "Odd number"
4. End
```

This pseudocode checks if a number is even or odd without worrying about the specific programming language. It breaks the problem into logical steps, allowing the developer to later implement it in any language.
